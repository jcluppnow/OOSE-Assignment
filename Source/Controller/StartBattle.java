        Begin by mixing water and baking soda to form a paste.
Spread the paste over the ink stain and rub it in with your fingers. Baking soda can be slightly abrasive, so avoid scrubbing too hard or it may damage the finish.
Moisten a soft cloth with plain water and scrub the area as you remove the paste.
For larger stains, repeat the steps above until all of the ink is removed.
If a haze is left on the surface from the baking soda, wipe the area with a cotton ball moistened with a small amount of rubbing alcohol to remove.
